## My process

### Built with

-HTML

-CSS

-Javascript chart.js


### What I learned

While I was creating the page, I've learned chart.js which what creates the bar chart you see on the page. there's also miniscule shorts cuts like ".class" which auto completes when creating a class which save major timing when and made working more efficiently
### Continued development

when trying to fetch the files from the json file, it didn't into bar chart which is why chose to creat the bar chart using chat.js. I would like to work more with data and able to manipulate json file in the future.
