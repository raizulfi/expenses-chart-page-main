## Overview

In the repo, I Recreated a expenses chart page which tracks your spending in span of 7 days. utilisng CSS, HTML and 
to achive it. When the user hovers over a specific day's bar, the amount spent on that day is displayed. It also displays their current balance and total expenses for the month, as well as a percentage indicating the difference from the previous month.
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day's bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See dynamically generated bars based on the data provided in the local JSON file

### What I learned

While I was creating the page, I've learned chart.js which what creates the bar chart you see on the page. there's also miniscule shorts cuts like ".class" which auto completes when creating a class which save major timing when and made working more efficiently
